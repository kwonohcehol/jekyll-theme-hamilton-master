To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snㅑippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
import sys
port = sys.stdin.readline

X = int(input())

for i in range(X):
    N = map(int,input().split())
    if i > N:
      print("success")
    elif i = N:
      print("droa")
    else:
      print("fail")
    
{% endhighlight %}
